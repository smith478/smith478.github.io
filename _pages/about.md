Welcome! I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning to tackle challenges, especially within the medical field. My 10-year journey through data science has been fueled by a desire to use the powerful new tools being developed to help automate processes and help others do their work more efficiently.

My Path:

After starting my career in academia as a visiting assistant professor of mathematics , where I researched different geometric properties of high dimensional spaces using geometric flows, I pivoted towards the exciting world of data science, which was then in its infancy. This shift was an opportunity to apply my deep math foundation and have a larger impact.

Professional Highlights: 

I’ve had an awesome opportunity to work in a number of fields from insurance to financial to veterinary medicine where I’ve had the chance to work on exciting projects from data analysis and reporting to computer vision and large language model projects. I’ve worked at larger organizations where I’ve had the resources to be in more of a research role and also a start-up where I was responsible for each component of the process.

Passion Projects (see the projects section):

Medical Imaging: A suite of tools for the classification and localization of abnormalities in medical images.
Medical Summarization and Transcription: Tools for transforming medical audio data into summarized text, enhancing accessibility, and understanding for healthcare professionals.
Looking Ahead:

As I continue to explore and expand, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations. Whether through my professional endeavors, academic contributions, or personal projects, my goal remains the same: to harness the power of data science to improve lives.
