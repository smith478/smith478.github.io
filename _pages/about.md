I have a passion for machine learning especially medical applications. 

For the last 10 years Iâ€™ve been building and supporting a range of machine learning models in different industries. I have experience with GLMs, tree based models (gradient boosting, random forest) applied to tabular data, imaging, and text/audio data. 

Prior to working on predictive models I was an assistant professor of math researching differential geometry and geometric analysis.
