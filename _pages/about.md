Welcome! I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning to tackle challenges, especially within the medical field. My 10-year journey through data science has been driven by a desire to utilize the emerging tools being developed to positively impact lives, fueled by a fascination and curiosity with the underlying techniques.

**My Path:**

After starting my career in academia as a visiting assistant professor of mathematics, where I researched geometric properties of high dimensional spaces using geometric flows, I transitioned into data science, motivated by the exicitng applications that were being developed. This shift was an opportunity to apply my deep math foundation and have a larger impact.

**Professional Highlights:**

I’ve been fortunate to work in a number of fields from insurance to financial to veterinary medicine, where I’ve had the opportunity to build exciting projects ranging from data analysis and reporting to computer vision and large language models. I’ve worked at large organizations where I’ve had the resources to be in more of a research role and also a start-up where I was responsible for each component of the process.

**Passion Projects:**

[Medical Imaging](https://github.com/smith478/medical-imaging): A suite of tools for the classification and localization of abnormalities in medical images.
[Medical Summarization and Transcription](https://github.com/smith478/medical-summarization-and-transcription): Tools for transforming medical audio data into summarized text, enhancing accessibility, and understanding for healthcare professionals.

**Looking Ahead:**

As I continue to explore and grow, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations. Whether through my professional endeavors, academic contributions, or personal projects, my goal remains the same: to harness the power of data science to improve lives.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out by email!
