Burnout has become a major issue in the medical profession with high caseloads and staffing shortages. After meeting with patients, clinicians will typically write up discharge notes that may include a summary of what they discussed and instructions, next steps, and any follow up that is needed. Creating these notes can be time consuming and there may be inaccuracies especially if the notes are not created soon after conversation. 

The main goal of this project is to build tools that can format and summarize these discharge notes automatically from text. This has become possible with the recent breakthroughs in automatic speech recognition (asr) along with general LLM capabilities to understand text. Including to summarize text. The idea is to take raw audio, use asr to convert it to text and then summarize and format the text. With the extracted text other applications are also possible, like extracting pieces of information or general question answering.
